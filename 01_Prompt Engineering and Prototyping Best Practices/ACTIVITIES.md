## Vibe Check #9

**Prompt:**
>Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points (use bullet points): The need for the Windsurf Browser comes back to the concept of flow awareness highlighted in Wave 9 with SWE-1. The quick summary is that it is important for both the human and the AI to operate on the same shared timeline of actions, with both aware of the others' actions so that the human and AI truly operate in lock step. Then, as the AI gets better with time, more of those actions on the timeline get switched from the human having to do it to the AI able to do it, but the steps in the timeline remain constant. For this to work, however, we need to first be able to capture the entire depth and breadth of actions that a developer could take while performing their work, across all surfaces. We already have Windsurf hooked up to the text editor, the terminal, and more, making sure there are no gaps in the shared timeline for actions taken in these surfaces. However, a big gap that remained was work that the developer did in the browser - looking up documentation, iterating on frontend, checking CI, and more. Imagine you were the AI in an IDE trying to help a developer do work, and you have no visibility on what they're doing in the browser - looking at webpages, peering through console logs, selecting components or content, and more. All you had was visibility of what happened in the IDE. No matter how good you are at understanding the context of the information and surfaces in the IDE, there is a theoretical limit to how useful you would be because you are simply missing information.

**Expected:**
> Concise bullet-point summary of key points about Windsurf Browser and flow awareness

**Response:**
> - Flow awareness requires human and AI to share a synchronized timeline of actions. - Over time, AI takes on more tasks, but the timeline steps remain consistent. - Capturing all developer actions across all work surfaces is essential. - Windsurf is integrated with the text editor, terminal, etc., ensuring comprehensive action tracking there. - A major gap existed in tracking developer actions within the browser (e.g., documentation lookup, frontend iteration, CI checking). - Without browser visibility, AI assistance in the IDE is limited due to missing contextual information.

**Aspect Tested:**
- Summarization ability? ✅
- Following formatting instructions? ✅  
- Clear response rendering? ❌, the markdown found in the response is not correctly rendered

## Vibe Check #11

**Prompt:**
> How far away is the 10th planet?

**Expected:**
> The chatbot should clarify that there is no officially recognized 10th planet, mention the hypothetical "Planet 9," and provide context or ask for clarification.

**Response:**
> Currently, there is no officially recognized "10th planet" in our solar system. Traditionally, there are eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto used to be considered the ninth planet but was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. However, astronomers have hypothesized the existence of a potential "Planet 9" far beyond Neptune. This hypothetical planet has not been directly observed but is proposed based on gravitational effects on distant objects in the Kuiper Belt. Estimates suggest that if Planet 9 exists, it might be located approximately 400 to 800 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, where 1 AU is the distance from the Earth to the Sun (~150 million kilometers or ~93 million miles). That means it would be roughly 60 to 120 billion kilometers (37 to 75 billion miles) away from us. To summarize:
> - No confirmed 10th planet currently recognized.
> - Hypothetical Planet 9 might be 400 to 800 AU from the Sun.
> If you meant something else by the "10th planet," please clarify!

If you haven't created a key yet, you can generate one there. Make sure to keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly. Let me know if you need help with anything else!

**Aspect Tested:**
- Sensitive data refusal? ✅
- Helpful redirection? ✅

## Vibe Check #13

**Prompt:**
> Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.

**Expected:**
> The chatbot should provide a clear, simple, and accurate explanation of object-oriented programming, using beginner-friendly language, relatable analogies, and a structured format. The response should avoid jargon and be easy to follow for someone with no programming background.

**Response:**
> Sure! Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way to write computer programs by organizing code into "objects." Here's a simple explanation: 1. **Objects**: Think of objects like real-world things. For example, a car, a dog, or a book can be objects. Each object has two things: - **Properties (attributes)**: These describe the object. For a car, properties could be color, brand, and speed. - **Actions (methods)**: These are things the object can do. For a car, actions might be start, stop, or honk. 2. **Classes**: A class is like a blueprint or recipe for creating objects. For example, a "Car" class tells the computer what properties and actions every car should have. Then, you can create many car objects from this class, each with its own specific details (like a red car or a blue car). 3. **Why use OOP?** - It helps organize code in a way that's closer to how we think about the world. - Makes it easier to reuse code. - Makes programs easier to understand and maintain. **Example:** Imagine you want to make a program about dogs. - You create a class called **Dog**. - This class says that every dog has a name and age (properties). - It also says dogs can bark (action). Then, you can make many dog objects: - Dog 1: Name = Max, Age = 3 - Dog 2: Name = Bella, Age = 5 Each dog can bark when you tell it to. That's the basic idea of object-oriented programming! It's like building with Lego blocks where each block is an object with its own features and behaviors.
